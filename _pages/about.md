你好！ / Hi! / こんにちは！ / Grüß dich!

My name is Kunhang Li (李坤航). I am a Computer Science MS student at [Miyao Lab](https://mynlp.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index) from [Graduate School of Information Science and Technology](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.shtml), [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index.html). I am currently researching language & physical knowledge with [Prof. Yusuke Miyao](https://researchmap.jp/yusuke/?lang=english). I used to be an old-school guy enjoying syntactic parsing, and developed several CCG parsers from scratch ([CCG-HPSG-Parser](https://github.com/KunhangL/CCG-HPSG-Parser), [multiCCG](https://github.com/KunhangL/multiCCG)). Previously, I completed my bachelor in Robotics at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I was involved in NLP (semantic parsing) and multimodality (text2motion) research with [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/).
