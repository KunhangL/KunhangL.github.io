Hi! I am a first year Computer Science MS student at [Miyao Lab](https://mynlp.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index) from [the University of Tokyo](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.shtml). I am currently researching NLP with [Prof. Yusuke Miyao](https://researchmap.jp/yusuke/?lang=english). Previously, I completed my bachelor in Robotics at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I was involved in NLP research with [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/).
